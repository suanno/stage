- The behaviour as a power law seems to NOT be present at any n, in opposite to what we expected.
The lower the T, the higher the $\tilde{n}$ after which we see the power law behaviour.
- The error on $C(nT)$ (that shall be zero at any t=nT) is of the order of 1e-14 for the wide range of considered dt values and is THE SAME (curves overlap) for any couple T,dt.
That was expected, since T/dt (that is Fixed) is the resolution with which the cosine is implemented in the code.
