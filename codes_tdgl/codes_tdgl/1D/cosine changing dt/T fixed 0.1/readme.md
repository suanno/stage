It seems that the value $\tilde{n}$ after which the power law behaviour is seen depends only on T and not on dt.
We say that, because we saw it depends on T/dt (the lower the T with T/dt fixed the higher $\tilde{n}$) BUT HERE we see it does not depend on $dt$ if $T$ is fixed.

There is one curve that deviates much, BUT the reason is that there are certain (a lot) of values n*T that are not multiples of dt and the deviation of the value of C considered Instead of C(nT) is 0.6 that is big compared to the sine amplitude (1).
